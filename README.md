# 📊 Superstore Sales and Profit Analysis Dashboard

In this project, I analyzed **Superstore data** to explore sales and profit trends, customer behavior, product performance, and category insights. Using **Tableau**, I created several visualizations to highlight top-performing products, customers, and categories based on sales and profit margins.

## 🖥️ Dashboard Visualizations  

1️⃣ **Top 10 Highest Sales by Country (Bar Chart)** – A **bar chart** showing the top 10 countries by sales amount. This helps identify which regions generate the most revenue, with the **US** leading as the top-performing market globally.  
2️⃣ **Best Selling Products by Quantity Sold (Table Chart)** – A **table** displaying product names along with their respective sales quantities. This chart highlights which products are the most popular, helping to understand product demand.  
3️⃣ **Highest Profit for Products (Map)** – A **map** visualizing profit margins by country, highlighting the highest profit-generating regions and products. The color gradients represent profit margins, making it easy to see geographical trends in profitability.  
4️⃣ **Profit Margin for Each Category (Pie Chart)** – A **pie chart** showing the percentage breakdown of profit by category. **Technology** stands out with the highest profit margin, indicating its key role in the business's success.  
5️⃣ **Highest Spending Customers (Bar Chart)** – A **bar chart** showing the highest spending customers along with their category of highest expenditure. The chart helps identify which customers contribute the most to the bottom line, providing valuable insights for customer loyalty strategies.
